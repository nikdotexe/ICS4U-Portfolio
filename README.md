<h1> My Reflection on this Semester</h1>
<p>In my first senior semester of my last year at highschool Computer Science was one of my most well enjoyed courses to take part in, for a plethora of reasons; the flexibility and leniency associated with the course, letting me use the time to focus on other courses if need be. And as well as many opportunities to give another layer of depth to knowledge I already had, For example; expanding my knowledge of HTML whilst learning jQuery and the DOM. And who can forget the coined Learn to Cube portion of our Algorithms unit. It made me face something that i had to go out of my way to understand which was really interesting to me</p>
